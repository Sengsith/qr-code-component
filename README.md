## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- Mobile-first workflow

### What I learned

This time in general, I was proud of my speed in being able to complete this project. There wasn't anything too complicated in this project.

### Continued development

I definitely want to focus on mastering a responsive layout. While I believe that this project looks good for specific mobile and desktop sizes, resizing the window between sizes causes it to grow and shrink in ways I would not like it to.
